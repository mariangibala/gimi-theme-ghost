## Styles editor
Styles editor source files are not included in this repository.
But the editor build is included and you can still run your own local copy of it.

* Don't inject child theme code when using the editor. When editor is active child theme code is generated on runtime. 
* Editor uses CSS selectors to identify elements ![(see here)](https://github.com/mariangibala/gimi-theme-ghost/blob/master/src/js/editor/config.js#L65) so be cerful with changing .scss 
```
npm run dev:include-editor -d "buildDestinationPath"
```
